## Issue

The status of the addons on the managed cluster ocp-dev-01 is unknown. 

## Environment

The hub must-gather path: `/Users/wliu1/Downloads/must-gather-case-03926591/hub`

## Task

1. Give the issue root cause by analyzing it based on the provided must-gather.
2. Try to give the solution based on the issue root cause

## Tools

### omc command

You could use the `omc` command to inspect resources from a `must-gather` in the same way as they are retrieved with the `oc` command.

Usage
Point the `omc` to a `must-gather`. This can be a local extracted must-gather, a local tarball, or a remote tarball:

```sh
omc use </path/to/must-gather/>
# Use it like `oc`:
omc get clusterversion # show OpenShift cluster version
omc get pods -o wide -l app=etcd -n openshift-etcd
```
